LOG
- started workingon this. i stiil do not what most of the instructions mean. asd
- had to do research on how to createa 2d matrix using.
- i have no trouble creating the matrix and displaying in the right format. but i do have trouble printing it in that format onto the file. 
-thus far, it does not put what i wanted to put. it putts a bunch of zero's and ones. 
- for the first attemp i used the function right. it is giving me the same problem as before. it continues to write the numbers in a weird format. this ofc does not refer to the matrix format but it seems to be tranlating to binary. but not the corect binary for the number. 
- bammm! got it to print the matrix elements on to the file in the right format using fprintf. 
n- thus far for the purpose of testing, i have been enterin the elements manually using scanf.
- now il wil swich to rand() % 100 to produce random numbers from 0 to 100.
- i had two differnt blocks of 2 nested for loops. then i decided to elimintte one of those block to so the matrix is being populated as well as printed ontot eh file in the same nested for loops.

SUMMARY:
- so far the program does not work for the second part.
