
Lab5

Build:
for Mac using subsystem Ubunto
cd /desktop/comp322labs/lab5

lab3/: make

Run:
./page
Log:
super simple program.
while i had to look at my notes for calculating the right offset and page size, no further research went into making this.
i did it in one run so there will only be one commit on github 

Summary:
program prints what is supposed to. in the manner that is supposed to.
