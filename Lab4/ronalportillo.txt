Build:

cd /desktop/comp322labs/lab4

lab3/: make

Run:
./dining-p
Log:
lots of research goes went into making the program work.
this is the only program in which i had to create a lot of helper classes. 
the first thing that was giving me trouble was the fork 
some some reason it always gave me a negative pid which meant that the fork failed. for an even stranger reason, it jsut worked one day 
this is also the first time i ever used methaforms, which was fun but i to this day i am not fully sure on how to make them work properly. 
 

Summary:
due to work and being a full time student at two different schools, i did not have enouh time to do the second part. but he dining part does work.
