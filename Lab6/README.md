LAB 6

BUILD:
$ cd /comp322labs/lab6
$ make

RUN:
./mole
./spiritd

LOG:
- for this project i decidd to start with the supporrtive function. i think you called it trivial function. i first had poblems with the path where the lab6.log you said it was well known. i did not know what you meant. i am hopping i did it right. for this par i used:
			log = fopen("lab6.log","a+");

		where as before, i was using the path to my repository... 
- for frist part of the project. it took a lot of reserach oh how the components work. the most that kick me butt was the locking of eliminating the moles fed by the moles function. 
- it does not work correctly but i will keep working on it,

SUMMARY: 
it does ont work proprly. and i am still not sure on how to test it.
